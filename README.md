# Energy consumption Forecasting using the JIT (Just In Time) Transformer Model

This repository contains code for energy consumption forecasting based on time series data using JITtrans model.

## Project Overview

This project applies JITtrans architectures to forecast time series data (energy consumption). 
The main code handles data preprocessing, models training, and evaluation, while the `model.py` file contains the model architecture.

The source code is related to the paper "Just In Time Transformers", by 
AHMED ALA EDDINE BENALI, MASSIMO CAFARO, ITALO EPICOCO, MARCO PULIMENO and ENRICO JUNIOR SCHIOPPA (submitted)
